# Sample-Web-Page
Very basic landing page utilizing HTML5 and CSS and a confirmation page utilizing PHP, HTML5, and CSS.

This web page is the landing page for a talent show sponsored by Strauss Youth Academy for the Arts, QuesTECH Learning, and the Radio People. The landing page is designed using HTML5 and CSS, and the one hyperlink on the page led to a WordPress form on the main syaa website (syaaonline.com/talentshowapplication). When submitted, the form called the php file (included in this git), which emailed a copy of the form information to two emails, saved the data in a MySQL database, and presented the user with a confirmation form, styled in the same manner as the original landing page.

NOTE: Originally, only the talent show application form was required, which is why it was developed as part of the already existing WordPresss site and is not included as part of this git; however, it became clear that we would need a landing page and confirmation page and the sponsors wanted those pages to have a different feel than the WordPress site, which led to the development of the git files. (It was determined that the talent show application did not need to be recreated and could serve as a stand-alone form.)
